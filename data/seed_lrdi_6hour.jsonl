Each day, every coder earns a score between 1 and 9 (both inclusive). A coder\u2019s total score is the sum of their scores over the five days. The total score of a day is the sum of the scores of the three coders on that day.\n\nFor every day from Day 2 to Day 5, the organizers compute the 2-day average for that day as the average of the total scores of that day and the previous day. (For example, if the total scores on Day 1 and Day 2 are 25 and 20, then the 2-day average on Day 2 is 22.5.) The 2-day averages for Days 2 through 5 are shown below:\n\n- **2-day Average:**\n  - Day 2: 15\n  - Day 3: 15.5\n  - Day 4: 16\n  - Day 5: 17\n\n|        | Day 1 | Day 2 | Day 3 | Day 4 | Day 5 |\n|--------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Keshav |   3   |   1   |   1   |   2   |   2   |\n| Priya  |   2   |   3   |   2   |   1   |   1   |\n| Naren  |   1   |   2   |   2   |   3   |   3   |\n\nEach day, coders are ranked based on their scores for that day: Rank 1 goes to the highest score. If two or more coders tie for the highest score on a day, they all get the best available rank (i.e., all get rank 1), and the next rank is skipped as usual. The daily ranks are given below. Additional information:\n- a. The total score on Day 3 is the same as the total score on Day 4.\n- b. Keshav\u2019s scores are always multiples of 3.
