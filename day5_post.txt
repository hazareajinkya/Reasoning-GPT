Project 5: Reasoning GPT 🧠

The Problem (A Personal Story):
For those who don't know, the DILR (Data Interpretation & Logical Reasoning) section in CAT is brutal. It’s not just math; it’s pure puzzle-solving under pressure.

As a past CAT aspirant who improved my DILR score from 82%ile to 97%ile (and even received an offer from IIM Indore back then—which I politely declined for another path!), I realized that the *method* matters more than just the answer.

When I gave new, unsolved DILR questions to standard LLMs (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude), they often struggled to solve them with an "easy," student-friendly approach. They gave answers, but not the *reasoning* a student needs to learn.

The Solution:
So I built Reasoning GPT – a custom RAG pipeline designed to not just solve DILR problems, but to help students actually develop their reasoning skills.

It goes beyond just outputting an answer. It explains the logic, breaks it down step-by-step, and helps build the intuition needed to tackle similar problems in the future.

How it works (The Engineering Under the Hood ⚙️):
1. **Multimodal RAG Ingestion:** Built a specialized ETL pipeline to construct a proprietary **Knowledge Base**. It extracts visual logic from video frames and syncs it with transcripts to create a dense "reasoning index" that standard LLMs lack.
2. **Dense Vector Retrieval:** Implemented a high-performance retrieval layer (using FAISS) to fetch relevant context. It searches the **latent space** for problem archetypes with similar *logic structures*, ensuring high recall for specific reasoning patterns.
3. **Context-Augmented Generation:** Uses **Few-Shot RAG** to dynamically inject expert "thought traces" into the **LLM's context window**. This **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** prompting forces the model to align with the expert's reasoning style: Intuition → Tabular Breakdown → Final Shortcut.
4. **Automated Table Generation:** A specialized post-processing layer detects the problem type (Circular Track, Matrix, Venn Diagram) and enforces a clean, markdown-based tabular format for the solution—crucial for DILR.

It’s effectively capturing the guided problem-solving approach of an expert mentor and making it available on demand.

(Special thanks to Emergent for helping me whip up this aesthetic frontend! 🎨 It really makes the complex logic look clean and approachable.)

Honesty time: I didn't build this entirely in one day. I started hacking on the core RAG pipeline on Day 4 because the idea of building a reasoning model for students was too exciting to wait. This one is genuinely special to me.

Let's move to Day 6! 🚀
